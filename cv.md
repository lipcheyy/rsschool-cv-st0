## About myself

My name is Vladislav, im 18 years old. I am a student of **Uzhhorod National University**.

At the university I got acquainted with such programming languages as C++, C#

Java and Python. I consider it my goal to become a web developer, since at the moment 

this is one of the most demanded jobs in the world. In addition, I myself am very 

interested in web development.
